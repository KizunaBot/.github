# Kizuna Bot – Decentralized Discord Bot with P2P Storage

## Overview

Kizuna Bot is a decentralized Discord bot that is being built to use peer-to-peer (P2P) storage to ensure data resilience, redundancy, and synchronization across multiple nodes. This bot leverages P2P communication, task sharing, and decentralized data management to function without central servers.

## Programming Flow

This checklist outlines the programming flow for the Kizuna Bot project. Follow the steps sequentially to ensure smooth development and integration.

### Initial Setup | Environment and Dependencies
- [ ]	Create the project repository.
- [ ]	Set up the project directory structure:
```
kizuna-bot/
├── src/                 # Source code
│   ├── bot/             # Discord bot logic
│   ├── p2p/             # P2P communication and storage
│   ├── storage/         # Local data storage and replication
│   └── utils/           # Utility modules (e.g., hashing, logging)
├── tests/               # Unit and integration tests
├── requirements.txt     # Python dependencies
├── README.md            # Project overview
└── LICENSE              # Licensing information
```

- [ ]	Initialize a Python virtual environment.

Add dependencies for:
- [ ]	Discord API (discord.py or alternative).
- [ ]	Networking (socket or py-libp2p).
- [ ]	Cryptography (hashlib).
- [ ]	Optional tools (e.g., kademlia for DHT).
- [ ]	Write a basic requirements.txt for dependency management.

### Discord Bot Core | Basic Bot Functionality

Create the bot structure:
- [ ]	Bot configuration (e.g., token, prefix, intents).
- [ ]	Command handling.

Implement basic commands:
- [ ]	ping – Respond with “Pong!”.
- [ ]	status – Display the bot’s current state.
- [ ]	Integrate bot with logging to track operations.

### P2P Communication Layer | Core P2P Network
Build a node that:
- [ ]	Listens for incoming connections.
- [ ]	Connects to other nodes dynamically.
- [ ]	Handles requests for data or metadata.

Implement peer discovery:
- [ ]	Use a static list for initial testing.
- [ ]	Implement dynamic peer discovery using:
- [ ]	Gossip protocol.
- [ ]	Multicast DNS (mDNS).
- [ ]	Test node-to-node communication:
- [ ]	Send and receive simple messages.

### Local Storage | Data Management
- [ ]	Create a local database to store data fragments.

Implement data storage functions:
- [ ]	Store data with unique keys.
- [ ]	Retrieve data by key.

Add basic error handling:
- [ ]	Handle missing keys gracefully.
- [ ]	Log failed data requests.

### Decentralized Storage | Data Distribution
Implement data fragmentation:
- [ ]	Split large data into smaller chunks.
- [ ]	Assign unique identifiers to each chunk.

Add data replication:
- [ ]	Define replication factor (e.g., 3 replicas per chunk).
- [ ]	Use consistent hashing to distribute replicas across nodes.
- [ ]	Create a system to request missing data from peers.

### Gossip Protocol | Synchronization
Develop a metadata exchange system:
- [ ]	Periodically share a list of stored keys with peers.
- [ ]	Request missing keys or data.

Implement a replication system:
- [ ]	Ensure all nodes hold the correct replicas for the data they store.
- [ ]	Replace lost replicas by requesting them from peers.

Add optimization for metadata size:
- [ ]	Use compact representations of keys (e.g., hashes).

### Content Integrity | Data Validation
Integrate cryptographic hashing:
- [ ]	Hash data upon storage.
- [ ]	Validate hashes during replication.

Implement tamper detection:
- [ ]	Reject data with invalid hashes.
- [ ]	Notify peers of detected corruption.

### Advanced Node Management | Indexing and Discovery
Add decentralized indexing:
- [ ]	Implement a lightweight DHT or a gossip-based index.
- [ ]	Maintain a mapping of keys to nodes.

Improve node discovery:
- [ ]	Share peer lists during metadata exchanges.
- [ ]	Allow nodes to join and leave dynamically without disrupting the network.

Downtime Handling
Add resilience mechanisms:
- [ ]	Save the local state before shutting down.
- [ ]	Reload the state on restart.

Ensure network recovery:
- [ ]	Rebuild connections after downtime.
- [ ]	Synchronize metadata and data with active peers.

### Bot Integration with P2P | Command-Based Interaction
Add P2P commands:
- [ ]	share <data> – Store and distribute data across the network.
- [ ]	get <key> – Retrieve data by key.
- [ ]	peers – Display the list of connected peers.
- [ ]	sync – Manually trigger a synchronization event.

Task Sharing
Enable dynamic task distribution:
- [ ]	Assign tasks to the least-loaded nodes.
- [ ]	Balance task execution across the network.
- [ ]	Add logging for task progress and completion.

### Testing and Debugging | Unit Testing
Write unit tests for:
- [ ]	Local storage functions.
- [ ]	P2P communication.
- [ ]	Metadata exchange.
- [ ]	Test hash validation and tamper detection.

Integration Testing
- [ ]	Simulate a network of multiple bot instances.
- [ ]	Test data distribution and synchronization.
- [ ]	Verify network recovery after downtime.

Stress Testing
- [ ]	Measure performance under high load:
- [ ]	Add many peers.
- [ ]	Store and request large datasets.
- [ ]	Optimize bottlenecks in communication or storage.

### Deployment
Node Distribution
- [ ]	Package the bot into a standalone executable for easy distribution.
- [ ]	Create a Docker image for deployment.
- [ ]	Provide setup instructions in the README.md.

Network Setup
- [ ]	Test the network with real users.
- [ ]	Monitor performance and identify areas for improvement.

### Documentation
Project Documentation
- [ ]	Write detailed usage instructions in the README.md.
- [ ]	Document the P2P architecture and data flow in docs/.
- [ ]	Create a troubleshooting guide for common issues.

Code Documentation
- [ ]	Add comments to explain key functions and logic.
- [ ]	Ensure consistent formatting and naming conventions.

### Future Enhancements
